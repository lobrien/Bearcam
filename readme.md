# Bearcam

This is an Apple TV app that displays a full-screen streaming Web video. Because tvOS does not have a WebView, this is done using functions found in AVKit. 

The demo code shows the live Webcam that is shown seasonally of brown bears hunting for salmon in Katmai National Park. 

The Webcam can be seen in your browser at http://explore.org/live-cams/player/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls. It's awesome because bears.
